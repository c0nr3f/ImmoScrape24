# ImmoScrape24
## Python programs to scrape Immoscout24 and Immowelt

The variables are mostly german and the code is not commented.

## Install packages
```
pip install bs4 selenium
```

## Further information
Make sure, that you have the right webdriver for the browser you want to use installed. I use Firefox in my example.

Run the ipynb or copy all the code to a Python file and run it there.

Be aware, that Immoscout may use a captcha. I was too lazy to automate it, so I added a timer for 15 sec to solve it by hand.
